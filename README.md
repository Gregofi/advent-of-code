# Advent of code 2022
Solutions for some of the aoc2022 puzzles.
Used as an opportunity to learn haskell. The solutions will definitely not be idiomatic code, since they are my first programs in this language. Many of the used constructs (like `BinaryTree` in the third puzzle) are already in the standard library, but I reimplemented them anyway to learn.
